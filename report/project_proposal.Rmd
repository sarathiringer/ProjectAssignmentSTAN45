# Introduction

In this project we aim to evaluate methods that can account for discrimination bias
in predictive models. This can for example happen when a data set on which the
model is based is unbalanced with regards to a certain group, i.e. observations 
are fewer. Bias can also be introduced in a model because the data reflect true
discrimination bias in the population. Take an employee wage data set as an
example. If a model, e.g., predicts equal wages between two groups when all
variables are available except for this specific grouping (say gender) have been
taking into account but different wages when gender is introduced there is
evidence of true bias.

How should this be handled? The problem of imbalanced data could be tackled by
using synthetic data, i.e. parametric bootstrapping of the original data set 
to even out imbalance. But how do different modelling methods fare when they
are being trained on such data?

The second problem is more difficult. In the example given above the easy way
to deal with such a problem is just to remove the biased variable for model 
training. However, when the problematic variable is correlated with
other predictors in the model the bias can persist even after removal.

# Aims

* Identify and evaluate methods for dealing with persisting discrimination bias.
    - Filter observations if not represented?
    - Manipulate target data?
* Evaluate models using synthetic data.
* Identify a method for quantifying fairness and compare accuracy vs. fairness
  in different models and methods.
