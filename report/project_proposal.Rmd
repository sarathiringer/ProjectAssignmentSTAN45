# Introduction

In this project we aim to evaluate methods that can account for discrimination
bias in predictive models. This can for example happen when a dataset on which
the model is based is unbalanced with regards to a certain group, i.e.
observations are fewer in one group compared to another. Bias can also be
introduced in a model because the data reflect true discrimination bias in the
population. Take an employee wage data set as an example. If a model, e.g.,
predicts equal wages between two groups when all variables are available except
for this specific grouping (say gender) have been taking into account but
different wages when gender is introduced there is evidence of true bias.

Common sources of similar bias in datasets are:

* Undersampled groups.
* Having skewed samples.
* Too few variables, i.e. a limitation of features for the model to train on.
* True biases in the world.

How should this be handled? The problem of imbalanced data could be tackled by
using synthetic data, i.e. parametric bootstrapping of the original data set 
to even out imbalance. But how do different modelling methods fare when they
are being trained on such data?

The second problem is more difficult. In the example given above the easy way
to deal with such a problem is just to remove the biased variable for model 
training. However, when the problematic variable is correlated with
other predictors in the model the bias can persist even after removal.

One way to handle this is to build algorithms optimising for fairness.
This is most often done by operationalising a non-discrimination criterion.

## Demographic parity

This criterion states that the target variable should be independent of
problematic, let us call them "protected", variables (such as race and gender).
In other words this means that if $Y$ is our decision and $X$ the problematic
variable in question:
$$
P(Y=1 | X=1) = P(Y=1 | X=0)
$$
However, this makes sure we cannot use $X$ as a predictor which we in some
circumstances want.

## Equalised odds

This criterion proposes that the predictor we use and the
protected variable should be independent conditional on the outcome, i.e.
if $G$ is the predictor we want to use:
$$
P(G=1|X=0, Y=1) = P(G=1|X=1, Y=1)
$$
## Well-calibrated systems

Similar to equalised odds, but this criterion propose that the *target*
and the prtected variable are independent, conditional on the *predictor*.
$$
P(Y=1|X=0, G=1) = P(Y=1|X=1, G=1)
$$

Applying any of the above criteria will require careful consideration when
choosing variables to be included in a given model and some accuracy must perhaps
be sacrificed. We therefore wish to evaluate how well these criteria would fare
when applied to different kinds of models and datasets. 

# Aim

* Evaluate non-discrimination criteria for dealing with persisting discrimination bias.
* Evaluate models using synthetic data.
* Identify a method for quantifying fairness and compare accuracy vs. fairness
  in different models and methods. 

# Example datasets

Since our aim is to evaluate methodology rather than to analyse a specific dataset
the choice of data matters most in that we want sets where some bias is present.
Examples include but are not limited to:

* Glassdoor gender pay gap. A dataset containing wage data and demographic
  from Glassdoor, along with education, field, seniority etc. [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap).

* Silicon valley diversity data. Diversity of the workforce in Silicon Valley. [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/silicon-valley-diversity-data).

* Wages (not ISLR). Containing both gender and race. [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/ljanjughazyan/wages).

* The Demographic /r/ForeverAlone Dataset (very imbalanced between sexes). [Source](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/the-demographic-rforeveralone-dataset).

# Example analyses

For continues wage data in the Glassdoor and Wages dataset the goal of the model
would be to predict wages between gender and/or racial groups. This would be done
using methods such as regression trees and neural nets. For the specific datasets 
mentioned no additional modification of the sets would be needed except for taking 
the log wage, due to the known skewness of such data. We would then compare
methods such as averaging out differences before training the model or filtering
non-representative observations (????). 

For the Silicon Valley and ForeverAlone data sets classification models would be built
using penalised logisitic regression and boosted classification trees. In the Silicon
Valley set the type of job held by an observation would be predicted and in 
the ForeverAlone set depression or attempt to commit suicide could be predicted.
In both these sets women are severely underrepresented and would thus constitute
the basis for our analysis of how to deal with such bias.
