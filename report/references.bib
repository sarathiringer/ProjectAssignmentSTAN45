	abstract = {Biased decision making by machine learning systems is increasingly recognized as an important issue. Recently, techniques have been proposed to learn non-discriminatory classiﬁers by enforcing constraints in the training phase. Such constraints are either non-convex in nature (posing computational difﬁculties) or don’t have a clear probabilistic interpretation. Moreover, the techniques offer little understanding of the more subjective notion of fairness.},
